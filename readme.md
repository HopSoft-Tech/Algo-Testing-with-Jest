## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of various algorithm solutions written in JavaScript, accompanied by test cases written with Jest. It serves as a resource for learning and understanding different algorithmic approaches and practicing test-driven development (TDD).

## Folder Structure

Each folder within this repository represents a distinct algorithm and includes:

- `algorithm.js`: The implementation of the algorithm.
- `algorithm.test.js`: The Jest test cases for the algorithm.

Example folder structure:

```
.
├── anagram
│   ├── anagram.js
│   └── anagram.test.js
├── arraychunk
│   ├── arraychunk.js
│   └── arraychunk.test.js
├── fizzbuzz
│   ├── fizzbuzz.js
│   └── fizzbuzz.test.js
├── getelementsbytag
│   ├── getelementsbytag.js
│   └── getelementsbytag.test.js
├── palindrome
│   ├── palindrome.js
│   └── palindrome.test.js
├── reversestring
│   ├── reversestring.js
│   └── reversestring.test.js
└── sum
    ├── sum.js
    └── sum.test.js
```

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithm-tests-with-jest.git
   cd algorithm-tests-with-jest
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running Tests

To run the tests for all algorithms, simply use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

This command will execute all the test cases using Jest and provide you with a summary of the test results.
